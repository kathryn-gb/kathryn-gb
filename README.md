- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kathryn. I'm a Renaissance data practitioner, passionate about making valid statistical inferences, generating useful imperfect models and scaling their impact with competence in software & data engineering principles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning solutions to common ML deployment challenges and heterogenous treatment effect estimation.
- ðŸ‘¶ This is my new personal account; I'll be slowly migrating work here as I have time! Nobody said it would be easy to be passionate about data science, gardening, bread and the outdoors all at once, but I try anyway.
